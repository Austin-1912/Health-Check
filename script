1. Pre (Before Automation) – Current Practices & Pain Areas

Health Check Process

Around 1000 devices globally (Cameras, Controllers, Servers, Achievers).

Entirely manual health checks by operators daily.

2-3 hours of manpower consumed each day.

High risk of human error in device status reporting.

No standardized documentation for downtime, uptime, or device failure frequency.

Delayed issue identification — no real-time alerts.

Multiple disparate systems for each device type.

Resource heavy process, diverting operators from active threat monitoring.


Alarm Tracker

Approx. 30,000 alarms generated monthly.

Manual data extraction and entry into an alarm tracker sheet.

Operators manually log actions taken and prioritize by severity (High, Medium, Low).

Manual breakdown by region, location, door, and employee.

2 operators dedicated full-time for alarm tracking and analysis.

Trend analysis done manually, highly time-consuming, prone to errors.


Live Occupancy

Manual report generation from access systems.

Data requires cleaning and manual analysis for occupancy and floor-wise counts.

Not real-time — people movement after report generation makes it outdated.

Accuracy issues due to human intervention.


Theme Alignment:
High dependency on manpower, reactive operations, delayed response times — a clear need to elevate operational efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making agility.

2. Current (After Process Transformation) – Elevated Practices

Health Check Process

Centralized Real-Time Dashboard implemented, covering 1000+ devices globally.

Live device status monitoring with instant visibility of online/offline status.

Trend analysis enabled — track device failure frequency and downtime durations.

Granular filtering by region, location, floor, and device type.

Decision-making elevated — system-driven data insights enable proactive maintenance (repair/replace decisions).

Reduced health check time by over 80%.

Operator manpower reallocated to focus on security incident response.

Elevated operational resilience and control.


Alarm Analysis Dashboard

Automated alarm trend dashboard with region, location, door, and employee breakdown in seconds.

Operators manually log actions taken, but:

Trend analysis is now instant and visual.

Quick identification of patterns (e.g. repeated pin errors, unauthorized door swipes).

Proactive interventions and escalations (e.g. employee pin resets, policy violations flagged to managers).


Significant time savings — eliminated manual trend reporting.

Enhanced situational awareness and incident management.


Live Occupancy

Still partially manual.

Report generation, cleaning, and analysis handled manually.

Not yet real-time, accuracy challenges persist.


Theme Alignment:
Elevated operational efficiency, response times, and decision-making through automation and centralization — moving from reactive to proactive security management.

3. Future Vision – Elevating Further

Health Check Process

Enhance user experience and dashboard interface for greater clarity and usability.

Decentralize dashboards to regional SOCs:

Direct access to region-specific device health.

Faster issue identification and resolution at local levels.

Further reduction in central GSOC load.


Incorporate AI/ML-based predictive maintenance insights — forecast potential device failures based on trends.


Alarm Analysis Dashboard

Integrate action logging directly into the dashboard.

Automate priority tagging based on predefined rules and historical patterns.

Introduce automated escalations and notifications for high-priority incidents.

AI-driven anomaly detection to identify outliers in alarm patterns for early intervention.


Live Occupancy

Build a real-time occupancy dashboard integrated directly with access control systems.

Live movement tracking with current and floor-wise occupancy.

Automated alerts for occupancy thresholds.

Improved accuracy and operational readiness for emergencies and resource planning.


Theme Alignment:
Future initiatives are purpose-built to elevate security operations further by enhancing visibility, decentralizing decision-making, reducing response times, and transforming reactive processes into predictive, proactive management.

Summary

Stage	Focus	Impact

Pre	Manual, resource-heavy, error-prone, reactive.	High human effort, slow response, risk.
Current	Centralized dashboards, automated trend analysis.	Time, manpower, and cost savings, elevated decision-making.
Future	Enhanced UX, decentralized tools, AI/ML integration.	Predictive, decentralized, agile, elevated control.
