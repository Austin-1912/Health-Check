1. Pre (Before Automation) – Current Practices & Pain Areas

a.	Health Check Process

•	2013 devices globally (Cameras – 709, Controllers - 70, Servers – 5, Achievers – 21, Doors – 565, Readers - 643).
•	Entirely manual health checks by operators daily.
•	2-3 hours of manpower consumed each day.
•	High risk of human error in device status reporting.
•	No standardized documentation for downtime, uptime, or device failure frequency.
•	Delayed issue identification — no real-time alerts.
•	Multiple separate systems for each device type.

b.	Alarm Tracker

•	Approx. 30,000 alarms generated monthly.
•	Manual data extraction from system and entry into an alarm tracker sheet.
•	Operators manually log actions taken and prioritized by severity (High, Medium, Low).
•	Manual breakdown by region, location, door, and employee.
•	2 operators dedicated for full-time alarm tracking and analysis.
•	Trend analysis done manually, highly time-consuming, prone to errors.


c.	Live Occupancy

•	Manual report generation from access systems.
•	Data requires cleaning and manual analysis for occupancy and floor-wise counts.
•	Not real-time — people movement after report generation makes it outdated.
•	Accuracy issues due to human intervention.

Theme Alignment:
High dependency on manpower, reactive operations, delayed response times — a clear need to elevate operational efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making agility.
2. Current (After Process Transformation) – Elevated Practices

a.	Health Check Process

•	Centralized Real-Time Dashboard implemented, covering 2000+ devices globally.
•	Live device status monitoring with instant visibility of online/offline status.
•	Trend analysis enabled — track device failure frequency and downtime durations.
•	Granular filtering by region, location, floor, and device type.
•	Decision-making elevated — system-driven data insights enable proactive maintenance (repair/replace decisions).
•	Reduced health check time by over 80%.
•	Elevated operational resilience and control.
 

 
 

 


b.	Alarm Analysis Dashboard

•	Automated alarm trend dashboard with region, location, door, and employee breakdown in seconds.
•	Operators manually log actions taken, but:
•	Trend analysis is now instant and visual.
•	Quick identification of patterns (e.g. repeated pin errors, unauthorized door swipes).
•	Proactive interventions and escalations (e.g. employee pin resets, policy violations flagged to managers).
•	Significant time savings — eliminated manual trend reporting.
•	Enhanced situational awareness and incident management.
 
 
-	Region Wise Breakdown of alarms

 
-Priority Wise Breakdown of alarms
 

 

c.	Live Occupancy

•	Still partially manual.
•	Report generation, cleaning, and analysis handled manually.
•	Not yet real-time, accuracy challenges persist.



Theme Alignment:
Elevated operational efficiency, response times, and decision-making through automation and centralization — moving from reactive to proactive security management.
3. Future Vision – Elevating Further

a.	Health Check Process

•	Enhance user experience and dashboard interface for greater clarity and usability.
•	Decentralize dashboards to regional SOCs:
•	Faster issue identification and resolution at local levels.
•	Incorporate AI/ML-based predictive maintenance insights — forecast potential device failures based on trends.


b.	Alarm Analysis Dashboard

•	Integrate action logging directly into the dashboard.
•	Automate priority tagging based on predefined rules and historical patterns.
•	Introduce automated escalations and notifications for high-priority incidents.
•	AI-driven anomaly detection to identify outliers in alarm patterns for early intervention.


c.	Live Occupancy

•	Build a real-time occupancy dashboard integrated directly with access control systems.
•	Live movement tracking with current and floor-wise occupancy.
•	Automated alerts for occupancy thresholds.
•	Improved accuracy and operational readiness for emergencies and resource planning.
 

Theme Alignment:
Future initiatives are purpose-built to elevate security operations further by enhancing visibility, decentralizing decision-making, reducing response times, and transforming reactive processes into predictive, proactive management.



Summary

Stage Focus Impact

Pre Manual, resource-heavy, error-prone, reactive. High human effort, slow response, risk.
Current Centralized dashboards, automated trend analysis.	Time, manpower, and cost savings, elevated decision-making.
Future	Enhanced UX, decentralized tools, AI/ML integration.	Predictive, decentralized, agile, elevated control.
